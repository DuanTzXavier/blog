# This is a new start for me

Honestly, I'd be studying English for my IELTS now, but I am typing some thing about my feeling that I worked in Ctrip these days.



I love my new work place, but some colleagues makes me think this place have a lot of people wast their life. They are busy to ingratiate their colleagues but work hard. I think just do I want to do and know I want to know is the life I'd have.



# My future life

These days, I thought about a question about my life what would you be this life. This is a large question. I just get some words about my future life.



## New Zealand

From pictureï¼ŒI already have been attract by there. And I want my children would live their own life not live for living. 



## Barcelona

I wanna to see matchs of Barcelona, and I love Messi. Maybe everybody love Messi for football fans. I want to see a real scene not some video.



## Boat

Oh, Sea. I love sea. But the sea of Shanghai is disgusting. That is red. The sea is polluted by Chinese GDP. And I want to buy a boat, sailing on the sea of NZ.
